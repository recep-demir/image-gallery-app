This project is an image gallery web application built with React. It fetches images from a data array and displays them in a responsive gallery layout. Each image has hover effects, and the photographer's name is displayed on the image.

## Features
- Responsive layout using Flexbox.
- Hover effect on images: Images zoom in and display a border when hovered over.
- Photographer names are displayed at the center of the images.
- Clickable images for more information or to open in full view (optional).
